### Introduction
This page compiles awesome-papers in the field of natural language processing. I will mainly deal with `sentence classification`. It will cover various NLP techniques, Embedding, Modeling, Data Engineering, etc.

### How to run
Please type below to run the project.
```bash
python mainGCN.py
```

And you can change training setups.
```bash
python mainGCN.py --lr=0.02 --epoch=100 --dataset='Cora'
```

### More Detail
You can see the structure of model in [here](./Models). It is helpful to programming.

And you can see how train model in [here](./Tools/Training.py). 

[This page](https://9tailwolf.github.io/study/nlp2) is a main page for Intermediate-Text-Classification.
